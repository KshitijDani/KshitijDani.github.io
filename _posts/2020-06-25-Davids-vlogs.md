title:  "David's Vlogs"
---
David Dobrik is a Slovakian living in the US since he was a kid. Initially starting off on Vine, he now has a Youtube and Tik Tok account. Why am I telling you about David's vlogs? Because David's vlogs are really awesome. They always make me laugh and smile and are always filled with beautiful things. 

His trademark 4:20 minute long vlog is always too short, leaving the user wanting more. The amount of content packed in that short time span keeps the vlogs fresh and the user excited for what's about to happen next. All though most of the things that David features in his vlogs seem to be random, there are parts and skits that appear again and again. Like when he "Ices" his friends and the resulting punishment is to drink a bottle of vodka while kneeling on one knee. Or when christmas is around the corner and he gets a new member of the "Vlog Squad" to become his "best friend" and redecorate the tree leading to a huge fight with the previous "best friends". All of these skits keep the vlogs content fresh and fun.

The members of the vlog squad enhance the quality even more. With multiple appearances by different people, as you get to know the members through the vlogs the higher the expectations of what they'll do next. It becomes very relatable. Jason's comdey, Dom being a "stupid" junkie, Josh's sarcasm make the videos soooo good. 

What also attracts people to the videos are the multiple times we see David being generous. Whether it is paying of student loans or buying new cars for his friends or a year long subscription of Chipotle for a homeless fan, through these acts od kindness you feel really great. 


While most people, when they first see David's vlogs, might think he's a crazy young guy with a lot of money doing crazy stuff, as you watch more and more, you forget all that and just concentrate on the fun and hilarious parts of the vlogs. Say what you want, but I feel everybody should watch David's vlogs, especially if they feel down and want to have a good time.
