I'm getting really bored at home, so I decided, why not write about something. And then I thought, how would I keep it with me forever (cloud?). And then I thought what can I do to make this a learning experience. So I decided to try out this an exercise, just writing about random stuff that I come accross while browsing the internet.

I like learning about new things, but I'm not very good at converying them to other people. So, I'm also going to use this medium as a way of self-improvement. 

To whomsoever reading this, there is going to be no particular order in which these posts are to be read, just click one and read it. Over time, I'll keep adding improvements, such as letting people comment. But as of right now, i just want to write about stuff in my head. 

What do I like to do? Well I love food, metal music, aviation, history and politics. Will this blog be about any of them. Yes, I will write some posts on some of these topics. But nothing controversial. This is just me going out there and appreciating different things about the world, not to criticise them. Everybody is entitled to their own opinion, and this is mine.
